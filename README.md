## Overview

**Project Title**: Modern Shared Calendar

**Project Description**: A calendar that is intended to be shared with a family unit. 

**Project Goals**: Create a place to store sign-in and event data. 

**Team Members**: Carter, Zack, Daniel, Mausham, Abishek, Jose, and Tanner

**Software Description**: A website that holds data, storing sign-in info and calendar events. 

**Architecture**: A simple HTML file that uses JavaScript to execute functions and populate data, and Firestore to hold the data. 

## Features

Software features we created:

1. Calendar View: The calendar displays the correct month and year, and clicking a day selects it.

2. Event Creation: Users can add a new event by providing an event name, start time, and end time. Events are stored locally.

3. Event Listing: Events for the selected day are displayed correctly, but their styling can be improved.

4. Responsive Design: The calendar and event sections are responsive across different devices.

5. Navigation Between Months: Users can navigate to the previous or next month using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons.

6. Firebase Integration: Integration of Firestore has been finished. 


## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Just go to the website

Instructions for using the software:

1. Create an account by typing an email and a password (requires a capital letter). This will sign you in as well. Or type your existing credentials and click "Sign In".
2. Click on a date to see its stored events. 
3. Add an event by typing its title and start/end time, then clicking "Add Event".

## Development Environment

## Reflections

Things that went well:

- Despite our many challenges, we were able to get our product up and running
- We all learned about branching and forking with GitHub
- Even though we all had other priorities, we could all trust each other to get it done by the end

Things that did not go well:

- Communication and attendance
- This class was on the back burner for many of us throughout the semester, so much of our progress did not come until the very end
- We completed our MVP, but there are many bugs and things we could have tried to fix, as well as other features we would have liked to add

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Display events on dates without clicking on each of them individually.
* [ ] Data validation with event start/end times.
* [ ] Increase security by adding more validation to the sign-in page.
